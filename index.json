The exploration of this problem in other contexts is more recent within the research community. For regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous, only a few solutions exist. Pre-processing strategies are among the most successful proposals for tackling this problem. In this paper we propose a new pre-processing approach for dealing with imbalanced regression. Our algorithm, SMOGN, incorporates two existing proposals trying to solve problems detected in both of them. We show that SMOGN has advantages in comparison to other approaches. We also show that our method has a different impact on the learners used, displaying more advantages for Random Forest and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines learners. ","tags":null,"title":"MetaUtil: Meta learning for utility maximization in regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In several predictive tasks the end-user attention is focused in certain regions of the domain of the target variable.\nAs opposed to standard predictive tasks where all target variable values are equally important, in these particular tasks the domain has a non-uniform importance for the end-user. In many real world domains, such as financial, meteorological or medical, we can find tasks that fit into this non-standard setting. In effect, for most practical applications we observe that there is important domain knowledge that must be accounted for when solving the corresponding predictive task.\nIn these tasks, the relevance of certain regions of the domain is associated to either high costs and/or severe consequences, or to important profits and/or benefits. Initially, the research community addressed these tasks through the development of the cost-sensitive learning theory which considers only the costs component. More recently, this theory evolved to the broader framework of utility-based mining. The utility-based learning setting allows the consideration of both costs and benefits that may derive from different domain information. Although more complex, the utility-based learning framework is also more intuitive from an end-user perspective and more thorough regarding the domain information representation.\nThe first efforts for including costs and benefits into the learning procedure were concentrated in tasks with a nominal target variable (classification tasks). Still, with time, it became clear that this learning paradigm was also applicable to regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous. In this thesis we focus on the utility-based learning problem. The youth of this broader approach, specially regarding regression tasks, results in the existence of several open issues that we tackled. In particular, we identified and addressed the following main challenges: i) development of a unifying framework for utility-based learning; ii) developmentof learning methods for optimising utility in regression tasks; and iii) proposal of new pre-processing methods for addressing the problem of learning from imbalanced domains.\nThe proposal of a unifying utility-based framework allows to better understand the characteristics of these tasks, while integrating both classification and regression problems. Moreover, using this framework we are also able to establish important connections between different predictive problems.\nThe second challenge is related with the lack of methods to address utility-based regression problems. When dealing with utility-based learning if the utility information is not incorporated into the learning procedure we are only able to obtain sub-optimal models. To solve this problem we propose and evaluate new methods that allow to maximise the utility in regression. We show that these methods are effective for different utility settings.\nThe third and final challenge is related with the particular sub-class of utility-based problems known as imbalanced domains. This is also a problem insufficiently studied in the context of regression tasks. We propose and evaluate several approaches to address this problem.\nAs a practical outcome of this work, we provide UBL, an R package for utility-based learning that integrates approaches for classification and regression tasks. The UBL package includes the proposals presented in this thesis, as well as many other approaches developed for utility-based classification, providing to the research community a tool for testing and comparing different alternative methods of addressing utility-based predictive tasks.\n","date":1537142400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537142400,"objectID":"73fd52ed9b7cef2d4d326d05a6380be5","permalink":"https://paobranco.github.io/news/defense-phd/","publishdate":"2018-09-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/defense-phd/","section":"news","summary":"PhD defended with sucess at Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Sciences, University of Porto, Portugal.","tags":null,"title":"PhD Defense - Utility-based Predictive Analytics","type":"news"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531267200,"objectID":"9a3e83e6c7c9996053847d04bdcfd194","permalink":"https://paobranco.github.io/publication/j5/","publishdate":"2018-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/j5/","section":"publication","summary":"Imbalanced domains are an important problem that arises in predictive tasks causing a loss in the performance on the most relevant cases for the user. This problem has been extensively studied for classification problems, where the target variable is nominal. Recently, it was recognized that imbalanced domains occur in several other contexts and for multiple tasks, such as regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous. This paper focuses on imbalanced domains in both classification and regression tasks. Resampling strategies are among the most successful approaches to address imbalanced domains.

Their benefits are commonly associated to the ability of reducing the bias and/or variance in learning tasks. Ensembles have been studied both for classification and regression tasks with uniform domain preferences. However, only for imbalanced classification these methods were thoroughly studied. In this paper we present an empirical study concerning the predictive ability of ensemble methods bagging and boosting in regression tasks, using 20 data sets with imbalanced distributions, and assuming non-uniform domain preferences. Results show that ensemble methods are capable of providing improvements in predictive ability towards under-represented values, and that this improvement influences the predictive ability of models concerning the average behaviour of the data. Results also show that the smaller data sets are prone to larger improvements in predictive accuracy and that no conclusion could be drawn when considering the percentage of rare cases alone.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation of ensemble methods in imbalanced regression tasks","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1497484800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1497484800,"objectID":"91a301e31d8e52a87bd1f3555effb389","permalink":"https://paobranco.github.io/publication/c8/","publishdate":"2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/c8/","section":"publication","summary":"Imbalanced domains are an important problem that arises in predictive tasks causing a loss in the performance of the most relevant cases for the user.

This attention has been mostly focused on two-classes problems. Fewer solutions exist for the multi-classes imbalance problem. From an evaluation point of view, the class imbalance problem is challenging because a non-uniform importance is assigned to the classes. In this paper, we propose a relevance-based evaluation framework that incorporates user preferences by allowing the assignment of differentiated importance values to each class. The presented solution is able to overcome difficulties detected in existing measures and increases discrimination capability. The proposed framework requires the assignment of a relevance score to the problem classes. To deal with cases where the user is not able to specify each class relevance, we describe three mechanisms to incorporate the existing domain knowledge into the relevance framework. These mechanisms differ in the amount of information available and assumptions made regarding the domain. They also allow the use of our framework in common settings of multi-class imbalanced problems with different levels of information available.","tags":null,"title":"Relevance-based evaluation metrics for multi-class imbalanced domains","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1497484800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1497484800,"objectID":"00375f3140c21e4b62dcfd18819dcbdb","permalink":"https://paobranco.github.io/publication/c6/","publishdate":"2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/c6/","section":"publication","summary":"The problem of imbalanced domains, framed within predictive tasks, is relevant in many practical applications. When dealing with imbalanced domains a performance degradation is usually observed on the most rare and relevant cases for the user. This problem has been thoroughly studied within a classification setting where the target variable is nominal. The exploration of this problem in other contexts is more recent within the research community. For regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous, only a few solutions exist. Pre-processing strategies are among the most successful proposals for tackling this problem. In this paper we propose a new pre-processing approach for dealing with imbalanced regression. Our algorithm, SMOGN, incorporates two existing proposals trying to solve problems detected in both of them. We show that SMOGN has advantages in comparison to other approaches. We also show that our method has a different impact on the learners used, displaying more advantages for Random Forest and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines learners.

One of these challenges concerns the recommendation of very recent news. To tackle this problem, approaches to the prediction of news popularity have been proposed. In this paper, we study the task of predicting news popularity upon their publication, when social feedback is unavailable or scarce, and to use such predictions to produce news rankings. Unlike previous work, we focus on accurately predicting highly popular news. Such cases are rare, causing known issues for standard prediction models and evaluation metrics. To overcome such issues we propose the use of resampling strategies to bias learners towards these rare cases of highly popular news, and a utility-based framework for evaluating their performance. An experimental evaluation is performed using real-world data to test our proposal in distinct scenarios. Results show that our proposed approaches improve the ability of predicting and recommending highly popular news upon publication, in comparison to previous work.","tags":null,"title":"A framework for recommendation of highly popular news lacking social feedback","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1470009600,"objectID":"1af7af8b30f3ac44e96ed23ddd754ffb","permalink":"https://paobranco.github.io/publication/j2/","publishdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/j2/","section":"publication","summary":"Many real-world data-mining applications involve obtaining predictive models using datasets with stronglyimbalanced distributions of the target variable.

We propose to predict violent crime using regression and optimize the distribution of police officers through an Integer Linear Programming formulation, taking into account the previous predictions. Although some of the optimization data are synthetic, we propose it as a possible approach for the problem. Experiments showed that Random Forest performs better among the other evaluated learners, after applying the SmoteR algorithm to cope with the rare extreme values.
